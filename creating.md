# Creating a new Mod

These are instructions to create an empty mod.

### Prerequisites: 

 * [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (minimum v3.13.4)
 * A supported C++ compiler ([clang](https://releases.llvm.org/)/[MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
 * [Geode CLI](https://github.com/geode-sdk/cli) (Make sure you [add the CLI](/docs/installcli) to your path environment variable)
 * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Highly Recommended)

### Development Guide

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Install the [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extensions for VS Code

3. Open up the command line and navigate to any directory where you'd like to create the project

4. Run `geode new <name>` and follow the prompts that follow

5. Open up the new directory in VS Code

6. Press F1 to open the Command Palette and run `CMake: Configure` (make sure to select an x86 generator)

7. Open up the Command Palette again and run `CMake: Select Variant` (select either `Release` or `RelWithDebInfo`)

Alternatively, you can run CMake manually without using VSCode or using another program (such as Sublime Text), however using the VSCode environment is highly recommended for Geode projects.

### Troubleshooting (MacOS only)

If the CLI doesn't seem to work by just typing in "geode" into Terminal, then go through with these steps.

1. Open up Terminal

2. Run - chmod +x /Users/Shared/Geode/bin/geode

3. Then run - export PATH="/Users/Shared/Geode/bin:${PATH}"

4. Type in "geode" again and a help menu should show up!

### Building With VSCode

To build with VSCode, simply press the `Build` button on the bottom bar or use the hotkey `F7`.

### Building manually

1. `cmake -B build -T host=x64 -A win32`

2. `cmake --build build --config Release`
